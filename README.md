# simple-dr-scripts
collection of my very simple dragonrealms scripts
- these are not designed to be run afk, they break/stop fairly often.
- require some manual setup, like changing weapons/spells manually inside scripts.
- as much as possible they are designed to be read/followed by someone new to programming.
- Current has "r" scripts for ranger, "e" for empath, "c" for cleric.

These script use lich by tillman https://lichproject.org/about.html as well as much of the work done by the DR community over at: https://github.com/rpherbig/dr-scripts

I normally hang out in the DR discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/012CV9CNB6YximtAZ
and try to check reddit once in awhile: https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonrealms/
